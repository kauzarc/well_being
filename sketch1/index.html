    <h1>Well being</h1>
    <h2>How does the amount and type of student loan debt acquired by university graduates affect their methods of
        repaying this debt and their financial stability in terms of savings, investments, and overall economic
        self-reported well-being in the future?

    <p>The character icons each represent a person. So one icon is equivalent to one line in the dataset. The color
        corresponds to the well-being. It's not visible on this version without interaction, but selecting one or more
        categories on the side will allow you to higlight the concencted persons. In addition, moving the mouse over a
        person will show all its features.</p>
